# qAlgorithms

Welcome to `qAlgorithms`, a comprehensive collection of C++ libraries designed specifically 
for processing analytical data. Our focus is on the non-target screening data domain, ensuring 
precise and reliable data processing for this complex field.

The `qBinning Beta` aims to expand the existing program by finding and eliminating edge
cases during the binning that lead to less accurate results and experiments with additional
control prameters throughout the entire program.

We are always open for suggestions and feedback regarding your useage of our algorithms,
so do not hesitate to open an issue on our github page.

## Philosophy
Unlike many traditional data processing tools, our algorithms do not rely on manual user input 
parameters such as thresholds. Instead, they intelligently leverage the inherent properties of 
the measurement data itself. This approach allows the algorithms to dynamically assess and 
utilize the quality of the data, ensuring robust and reproducible results every time.

qAlgorithms aims to make your processing as fast as possible, so you don't have to spend more
time waiting for your computer to finish than evaluating results.

## Scientific Rigor
Our commitment to scientific validity is unwavering. The algorithms within `qAlgorithms` are 
rooted in well-established statistical tests. Our primary goal is to deliver results that 
aren't just accurate but also statistically significant, providing confidence in every analysis.

## Current Offerings

### qCentroids Algorithm
Our current flagship algorithm, `qCentroids` by Reuschenbach, Renner et al. 
[https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-022-04224-y], is tailored for centroiding HRMS 
spectra. It excels in handling data from instruments like Orbitrap and TOF, 
converting their profile spectra into centroided data. Whether you're dealing with 
high-resolution mass spectrometry data or other analytical measurements, `qCentroids` 
offers a reliable solution without the usual hassles of parameter tweaks.

### qBinning Algorithm
The `qBinning` algorithm utilises the centroids generated by `qCentroids` to
produce extracted ion chromatograms. Like `qCentroids`, it requires no user
parameters. Binning allows you to reduce the amount of centroids considered
in future analysis by roughly 30%. The current `qBinning` program is based
on the algorithm presented by Reuschenbach, Renner et al. [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01079],
but implements additional steps for finding the highest amount of statistically
sound bins.

### qPeaks Algorithm
As the current end point of qAlgorithms, `qPeaks` uses a comprehensive peak model 
developed by Renner et al. [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.4c00494] to 
identify peaks within the bins generated by qBinning. Every peak is statistically
significant, sidestepping the need for further filtering steps like a minimum
intensity requirement. The scores generated provide you with information about
how well every step of the process to your peak worked, and allow you to make
a statement about the confidence of your results. Like all parts of the qAlgorithms
project, `qPeaks` requires no user parameters.

## Future Roadmap
Our team is continuously researching and developing new algorithms to expand 
the capabilities of `qAlgorithms`. Stay tuned for more innovative solutions 
for analytical data processing!
